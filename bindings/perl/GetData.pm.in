=head1 NAME

GetData - Perl bindings to the GetData library for Dirfile access

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use GetData;

  my $DIRFILE = GetData::open("./dirfile/", $GetData::RDONLY);

  # the following calls are equivalent
  my $data = GetData::getdata($DIRFILE, "field", 5, 0, 1,
                              GetData::UINT8);
  my $data = $DIRFILE->getdata("field", 5, 0, 1, GetData::UINT8);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides simple, lightweight bindings from Perl to the C GetData
library.  It provides a simple mapping between public C functions and Perl
methods.  All C functions and constants are replicated in the GetData package.
These methods have the same name as their C counterparts, excluding the C
namespace prefix `gd_' (or `GD_', for C preprocessor constants).

The dirfile lvalue returned by GetData::cbopen or GetData::cbopen is a
simplistic object.  Any GetData method which takes a dirfile as a parameter,
may instead be called as method of the dirfile object itself.  (See the
synopsis above for an example.)  Dirfile metadata entries (which are C structs
of type gd_entry_t) are represented as simple hashes.

By default, GetData does not export any symbols.  All symbols in the GetData
package may be exported with:

  use GetData "all";

but this is discouraged, as it will overwrite useful things like &open.

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item cbopen ( DIRFILENAME, FLAGS, SEHANDLER, EXTRA )

Create or open a Dirfile database called DIRFILENAME.  FLAGS should be either
$GetData::RDONLY (for read-only access) or $GetData::RDWR (for read-write
access), optionally bitwise or'd with any of the flags listed in the
gd_cbopen(3) manual page.

SEHANDLER is a Perl callback function which will be executed whenever a syntax
error is encountered.  It may be undef, if no callback is desired (but see the
open() method in that case).  If called, SEHANDLER will be passed two arguments.
The first is a reference to a hash containing the parser data.  The second is
the EXTRA object passed to cbopen().  SEHANDLER is called in scalar context,
and should return either:

=over

=item * an integer, one of the $GetData::SYNTAX_... constants; or

=item * a string containing the corrected line, in which case
$GetData::SYNTAX_RESCAN is assumed; or,

=item * a reference to a list consisting of an integer, one of the
$GetData::SYNTAX_...  constants, and then, optionally, a string containing the
corrected line.

=back

This function always returns a valid Dirfile object, even if the call failed;
the caller should check GetData::error() on the returned dirfile to test for
success.
