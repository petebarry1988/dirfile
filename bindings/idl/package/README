IDL BINDINGS FOR GETDATA
========================

This package provides bindings to the GetData library for use with the
Interactive Data Language (IDL) developed by Research Systems, Incorporated,
now ITT Visual Information Solutions.

Building the IDL bindings with this package requires a system with a copy of
GetData already installed.  If you do not already have the GetData library, you
may want to download and install the entire GetData Project instead, which
includes these bindings.  GetData source packages, as well as more information
on the GetData Project, may be found on the World Wide Web:

  http://getdata.sourceforge.net/

CONTENTS
========

This package provides bindings for the Interactive Data Language (IDL) to the
GetData library.  Documentation for the bindings can be found in file
`README.idl' in the top level directory.  The C interface is described in this
document and the associated man pages.

A full list of features new to this release of GetData may be found in the
file called `NEWS', including features new to this copy of the IDL bindings.


BUILDING THE BINDINGS
=====================

This package may be configured and built using the GNU autotools.  Generic
installation instructions are provided in the file called `INSTALL'.  A
brief summary follows.  A C99-compliant compiler is required to build (but not
to use) the bindings.

Most users should be able to build the package by simply executing:

  $ ./configure
  $ make

from the top IDL GetData directory (the directory containing this README file). 
After the project has been built, you may (optionally) test the build by
executing:

  $ make check

which will run a series of self-tests.  Finally,

  $ make install

will install the bindings, and documentation.

The package configuration can be changed, if the default configuration is
insufficient, before building it by passing options to ./configure.  Running

  $ ./configure --help

will display a brief help message summarising available options.


PREREQUISITES
=============

These bindings require GetData 0.7 or newer to build, as well as an IDL
interpreter verison 5.5 or later.  No other external libraries are required,
save for the C Standard Library.
