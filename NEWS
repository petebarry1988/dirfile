New in version 0.3.0:

  Dirfile Changes

  * GetData now supports Dirfile Standards Version 5 which includes support
    for signed 8-bit, and signed and unsigned 64-bit integer types.
  * As part of Standards Version 5, the restriction on field name length has
    been removed.  (The filesystem will impose an effective limit on RAW fields
    of a few hundred character, and format file lines are limited to several
    thousand.)
  * The library can now convert between big and little endiannesses.  A
    directive, ENDIAN (added in Standards Version 5), is available to specify
    the byte-sex of a dirfile.

  API Changes

  * There is a new interface which fixes issues with thread safety and largefile
    support in the old interface.  The old interface (referred to as the "legacy
    API") is still supported, but doesn't fully implement Dirfile Standards
    Version 5.  See the README for full details.
  * putdata now respects FRAMEOFFSET.
  * putdata can now write to PHASE fields, and multi-bit BIT fields.
  * Some error codes have been renamed, and others removed or added, in order to
    regularise error codes between getdata and putdata in the sundry versions.
    Furthermore, the underlying values of some of these codes have changed
    (notably excluding GD_E_OK, which is guaranteed to be zero). Changes
    include:

      - GD_E_OPEN_FORMAT is now called GD_E_OPEN
      - GD_E_BAD_RETURN_TYPE is now called GD_E_BAD_TYPE
      - GD_E_NO_RAW_FIELDS is now called GD_E_EMPTY
      - PD_E_MULT_LINCOM is now called GD_E_BAD_PUT_FIELD
      - GD_E_OPEN_RAWFIELD and PD_E_OPEN RAWFIELD are now both represented by
          GD_E_RAW_IO
      - PD_E_BAD_CODE is now handled by GD_E_BAD_CODE
      - GD_E_FIELD, GD_E_SIZE_MISMATCH, ENDIAN_ERROR, CLOSE_ERROR are no longer
        applicable and have been removed
      - PD_E_CLOSE_RDONLY, PD_E_WRITE_LOCK, PD_E_FLOCK_ALLOC, which were were
        defined in the header but never used, have been removed
      - GD_E_TRUNC, GD_E_CREAT, GD_E_BAD_DIRFILE, GD_E_RANGE and GD_E_ACCMODE
        are new

    This affects the legacy API.
  
  Legacy API Changes

  * The legacy API has been marked deprecated.
  * Error codes have changed per the description above.
  * Only the public members of FormatType are now initialised by GetFormat.

  Bindings

  * Added bindings for C++ (libdirfile), Fortran 77 (libfgetdata), and
    Fortran 95 (libf95getdata)

  Miscellaneous

  * A rudimentary, but thorough, test-suite has been made.
