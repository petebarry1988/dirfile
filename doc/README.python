PYTHON BINDINGS FOR GETDATA
============================

The python bindings consist of a python extension module, `pygetdata.so'.  They
should work with Python version 2.2, or any later 2.x version.  Full
documentation for the Python bindings to the GetData library is contained
within the pygetdata module itself.  To read this documentation, execute

$ pydoc pygetdata

from the system shell, or

>>> import pygetdata
>>> help(pygetdata)

from within the Python interpereter.
