.TH dirfile_alter_encoding 3 "8 December 2008" "Version 0.5.0" "GETDATA"
.SH NAME
dirfile_alter_encoding \(em modify the binary encoding of data in a dirfile
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <getdata.h>
.HP
.nh
.ad l
.BI "int dirfile_alter_encoding(DIRFILE *" dirfile ", unsigned int " encoding ,
.BI "int " fragment_index ", int " recode );
.hy
.ad n
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR dirfile_alter_encoding ()
function sets the binary encoding of the format file fragment specified by
.I fragment_index
to
.I byte_sex
in the dirfile(5) database specified by
.IR dirfile .
The binary encoding of a fragment indicate the encoding of data stored in binary
files associated with
.B RAW
fields defined in the specified fragment.  The binary encoding of a fragment containing
no
.B RAW
fields is ignored.

The
.I byte_sex
argument should be one of the following:
.IP
.nh
.ad l
.BR GD_UNENCODED ,\~ GD_TEXT_ENCODED ,\~ GD_SLIM_ENCODED ,\~
.BR GD_GZIP_ENCODED ,\~ GD_BZIP2_ENCODED .
.ad n
.hy
.P
See
.BR dirfile_cbopen (3)
and dirfile-encoding(5) for the meanings of these symbols and details on the
supported encoding schemes.
.P
In addition to being simply a valid fragment index,
.I fragment_index
may also be the special value
.BR GD_ALL_FRAGMENTS ,
which indicates that the frame offset of all fragments in the database should
be changed.

If the
.I recode
argument is non-zero, this call will recode the binary data of affected
.B RAW
fields to account for the change in binary encoding.  If the encoding of the
fragment is encoding insensitive, or if the data type is only one byte in
size, no change is made.  If
.I recode
is zero, affected binary files are left untouched.

.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful completion,
.BR dirfile_alter_encoding ()
returns zero.  On error, it returns -1 and sets the dirfile error to a non-zero
error value.  Possible error values are:
.TP 8
.B GD_E_ACCMODE
The specified dirfile was opened read-only.
.TP
.B GD_E_ALLOC
The library was unable to allocate memory.
.TP
.B GD_E_BAD_DIRFILE
The supplied dirfile was invalid.
.TP
.B GD_E_BAD_INDEX
The supplied index was out of range.
.TP
.B GD_E_PROTECTED
The metadata of the specified format file fragment was protected from change,
or the binary data of the fragment was protected from change and binary file
recoding was requested.
.TP
.B GD_E_RAW_IO
An I/O error occurred while attempting to recode a binary file.
.TP
.B GD_E_UNKNOWN_ENCODING
The encoding scheme of the fragment is unknown.
.TP
.B GD_E_UNSUPPORTED
The encoding scheme of the fragment does not suport binary file recoding.
.P
The dirfile error may be retrieved by calling
.BR get_error (3).
A descriptive error string for the last error encountered can be obtained from
a call to
.BR get_error_string (3).
.SH NOTES
A binary file recoding occurs out-of-place.  As a result, sufficient space
must be present on the filesystem for the binary files of all
.B RAW
fields in the fragment both before and after translation.  If all fragments
are updated by specifying
.BR GD_ALL_FRAGMENTS ,
the recoding occurs one fragment at a time.
