.SH DESCRIPTION
This version of
.BR putdata (3)
uses a 64-bit offset type, even if
.I off_t
is a 32-bit type.  It is only available if one defines
.IR _LARGEFILE64_SOURCE .
If
.I off_t
is a 64-bit type (ie. if
.I _FILE_OFFSET_BITS
is defined to be 64), this function will be called
.BR putdata ().
Otherwise,
.BR putdata ()
will be a version of this function which uses a 32-bit
.IR off_t .
