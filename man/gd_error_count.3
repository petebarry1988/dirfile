.SH NAME
gd_error_count \(em report the number of errors encountered by the GetData
library
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #inlcude <getdata.h>
.HP
.nh
.ad l
.BI "int gd_error_check(DIRFILE *" dirfile );
.hy
.ad n
.SH DESCRIPTION
The first time
.BR gd_error_count ()
is called with the DIRFILE object
.IR dirfile ,
it returns the number of errors encountered by the GetData library while
operating on the specified DIRFILE object, since the DIRFILE's creation.
Calling this function resets the internal count, so that subsequent calls to
.BR gd_error_count ()
return the number of errors encountered only since the previous call to this
function, for the specified DIRFILE.

The errors themselves are not cached by the library.  The
.I last
error encountered by the library for
.I dirfile
can be obtained by calling
.BR gd_error (3).

.SH RETURN VALUE
The
.BR gd_error_count ()
function always returns the number of GetData errors encountered since the last
time it was called, or since the dirfile was created. This will be zero, if no
error has occurred over the given time.
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR gd_error (3),
.BR gd_error_string (3)
