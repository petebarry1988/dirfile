.TH dirfile_include 3 "8 December 2008" "Version 0.5.0" "GETDATA"
.SH NAME
dirfile_include \(em add a format file fragment to a dirfile
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <getdata.h>
.HP
.nh
.ad l
.BI "DIRFILE* dirfile_include(DIRFILE *" dirfile ", const char *" include_file ,
.BI "int " parent_fragment ", unsigned int " flags );

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR dirfile_include ()
adds the format file fragment specified by the path
.I include_file
to the specified dirfile, possibly creating the fragment.  This occurs as if,
in the existing fragment indexed
by
.IR parent_fragment ,
the following directive were present:
.IP
.BI "/INCLUDE " <include_file>
.P
(see
.BR dirfile-format (5)).
If a parser callback function had been specified when the dirfile was opened
using
.BR dirfile_cbopen (3),
this callback function will be called if a syntax error is encountered while
parsing the included fragment.

The 
.I flags
argument should be a bitwise-or'd collection of the following flags, or zero
if no flags are desired:
.TP
.B GD_BIG_ENDIAN
Specifies that raw data on disk is stored as big-endian data (most significant
byte first).  Specifying this flag along with the contradictory
.BR GD_LITTLE_ENDIAN 
will cause the library to assume that the endianness of the data is opposite to
that of the native architecture.

This flag is ignored completely if an
.B ENDIAN
directive occurs in the fragment, unless
.B GD_FORCE_ENDIAN
is also specified.
.TP
.B GD_CREAT
An empty fragment will be created, if one does not already exist.  The fragment
will have mode
.BR S_IRUSR " | " S_IWUSR " | "  S_IRGRP " | "  S_IWGRP " | " S_IROTH " | " S_IWOTH
(0666), modified by the caller's umask value (see
.BR umask (2)).
.TP
.B GD_EXCL
Ensure that this call creates a new fragment: when specified along with
.BR GD_CREAT ,
the call will fail if the dirfile specified by
.I dirfilename
already exists.  Behaviour of this flag is undefined if
.B GD_CREAT
is not specified.  This flag suffers from all the limitations of the
.B O_EXCL
flag as indicated in
.BR open (2).
.TP
.B GD_FORCE_ENCODING
Specifies that
.B ENCODING
directives (see
.BR dirfile-format (5))
found in the fragment should be ignored.  The encoding scheme
specified in
.I flags
will be used instead (see below).
.TP
.B GD_FORCE_ENDIAN
Specifies that
.B ENDIAN
directives (see
.BR dirfile-format (5))
found in the fragment should be ignored.  When specified with one of
.BR GD_BIG_ENDIAN " or " GD_LITTLE_ENDIAN ,
the endianness specified will be assumed.  If this flag is specified with
neither of those flags, the dirfile will be assumed to have the endianness of the
native architecture.
.TP
.B GD_IGNORE_DUPS
If the fragment specifies more than one field with the same name, or a field 
with the same name as an existing field, all but one of them will be ignored by
the parser.  Without this flag, parsing would fail with the
.B GD_E_FORMAT 
error, possibly resulting in invocation of the registered callback function.
Which of the duplicate fields is kept is not specified, nor whether an existing
field takes precedence over a new one or not.  As a result, this flag is
typically only useful in the case where identical copies of a field
specification line are present.

No indication is provided to indicate whether a duplicate field has been
discarded.  If finer grained control is required, the caller should handle
.B GD_E_FORMAT_DUPLICATE
suberrors itself with an appropriate callback function.
.TP
.B GD_IGNORE_REFS
If the dirfile currently has a reference field (either because one was specified
explicitly, or else because the first
.B RAW
field was used),
.B /REFERENCE
directives in the included fragment will be ignored.  Otherwise, a
.B /REFERENCE
directive in the included fragment will replace the current reference field in
the dirfile.
.TP
.B GD_LITTLE_ENDIAN
Specifies that raw data on disk is stored as little-endian data (least
significant byte first).  Specifying this flag along with the contradictory
.BR GD_BIG_ENDIAN 
will cause the library to assume that the endianness of the data is opposite to
that of the native architecture.

This flag is ignored completely if an
.B ENDIAN
directive occurs in the fragment, unless
.B GD_FORCE_ENDIAN
is also specified.
.TP
.B GD_PEDANTIC
Specifies that unrecognised lines found during the parsing of the fragment
should always cause a fatal error.  Without this flag, if a
.B VERSION
directive (see
.BR dirfile-format (5))
indicates that the dirfile being opened conforms Standards Version newer than
the version understood by the library, unrecognised lines will be silently
ignored.
.TP
.B GD_TRUNC
If
.I include_file
already exists , it will be truncated before opening.  If the file does not
exist, this flag is ignored.

.P
The
.I flags
argument may also be bitwise or'd with one of the following symbols indicating
the default encoding scheme of the dirfile.  Like the endianness flags, the
choice of encoding here is ignored if the encoding is specified in the dirfile
itself, unless
.B GD_FORCE_ENCODED
is also specified.  If none of these symbols is present,
.B GD_AUTO_ENCODED
is assumed, unless the
.BR dirfile_include ()
call results in creation or truncation of the dirfile.  In that case,
.B GD_UNENCODED
is assumed.  See
.BR dirfile-encoding (5)
for details on dirfile encoding schemes.
.TP
.B GD_AUTO_ENCODED
Specifies that the encoding type is not known in advance, but should be detected
by the GetData library.  Detection is accomplished by searching for raw data
files with extensions appropriate to the encoding scheme.  This method will
notably fail if the the library is called via
.BR putdata (3)
to create a previously non-existent raw field unless a read is first
successfully performed on the dirfile.  Once the library has determined the
encoding scheme for the first time, it remembers it for subsequent calls.
.TP
.B GD_SLIM_ENCODED
Specifies that raw data files are compressed using the slimlib library.
.TP
.B GD_TEXT_ENCODED
Specifies that raw data files are encoded as text files containing one data
sample per line.  
.TP
.B GD_UNENCODED
Specifies that raw data files are not encoded, but written verbatim to disk.

.SH RETURN VALUE
On success,
.BR dirfile_include ()
returns the format file index of the newly added fragment.  On error, -1 is
returned and the dirfile error is set to a non-zero error value.  Possible error
values are:
.TP 8
.B GD_E_ACCMODE
The supplied dirfile was opened in read-only mode.
.TP
.B GD_E_ALLOC
The library was unable to allocate memory.
.TP
.B GD_E_BAD_DIRFILE
The supplied dirfile was invalid.
.TP
.B GD_E_BAD_INDEX
The supplied parent fragment index was out of range.
.TP
.B GD_E_BAD_REFERENCE
The reference field specified by a
.B /REFERENCE
directive in the fragment (see
.BR dirfile-format (5))
was not found, or was not a
.B RAW
field.
.TP
.B GD_E_CALLBACK
The registered callback function returned an unrecognised response.
.TP
.B GD_E_FORMAT
A syntax error occurred in the fragment.
.TP
.B GD_E_INTERNAL_ERROR
An internal error occurred in the library while trying to perform the task.
This indicates a bug in the library.  Please report the incident to the
maintainer.
.TP
.B GD_E_OPEN_INCLUDE
The fragment could not be opened or created.
.TP
.B GD_E_PROTECTED
The metadata of the parent fragment was protected from change.
.TP
.B GD_E_REFERENCE
The included fragment contained a
.B /REFERENCE
directive which referred to a non-existent field, or a field that was not of
type
.BR RAW .
In this case, the included fragment will still be added to the dirfile, but
the
.B /REFERENCE
directive will be ignored.  See also the
.B BUGS
section below.
.P
The dirfile error may be retrieved by calling
.BR get_error (3).
A descriptive error string for the last error encountered can be obtained from
a call to
.BR get_error_string (3).
When finished with it, the DIRFILE object may be deallocated with a call to
.BR dirfile_close (3),
even if the open failed.
.SH BUGS
If this function fails with the error
.BR GD_E_REFERENCE ,
it typically results in no reference field being defined for the dirfile, even
if the dirfile contains
.B RAW
fields.  As a result, functions which rely on the reference field, such as
.BR get_nframes (3),
will operate incorrectly.  Callers should explicitly set the reference field
with
.BR dirfile_reference (3)
in this case.
